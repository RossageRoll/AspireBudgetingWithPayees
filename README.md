# Welcome
This is a lighlty modified version of Aspire Budgeting. In this version, I have added payees to the transactions page, as well as created a payee inflow/ outlow report, similar to the Category Reports page.

You can find a copy of the sheet for you to copy [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mYRhGwoYGuQtVcLoTDYOoj8bbAPKFR3uaEPV7IGM0yE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Notes on this Version
* Payees can be manually added to column “B” in the “Payees” tab, once entered there, they will automatically appear in the drop down list for transactions.
* If you don’t have a payee entered, you can either manually add it like above, or in the “Transactions” tab, you can enter the payee name in the pink cell at the top right of the tab, hit enter and then CLICK on “Add”. Note, you have to click, as this is a drawing with a script attached.
* While there is an Apps Script associated with this version, it does not rely on it and it can even be completely removed.
* At this stage, the Payee column has to be in column “J” in “Transactions” otherwise it will conflict with the base functions of the sheet as well as the iOS mobile app (I can’t verify this conflict for Android). Column “I” can be hidden as it’s not currently used, I just leave it there for a nice buffer between the functions at the top of the page.
